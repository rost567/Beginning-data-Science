We will use data published by the World Bank about population in countries.  

The process is:  
-1. Changing column headers, because those are values, not variable names.
-2. Using data about the average height in countries around the world. It comes from Kaggle.
-3. manipulating the dataframe "height" to be tidy. Currently, multiple variables are stored in one column.
