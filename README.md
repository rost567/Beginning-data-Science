We will use data published by the World Bank about population in countries.  

The process is:  
**PART 1**  
- Changing column headers, because those are values, not variable names.
- Using data about the average height in countries around the world. It comes from Kaggle.
- Manipulating the dataframe "height" to be tidy. Currently, multiple variables are stored in one column.
- Working with data about billboards in the 2000s.
- Manipulating the dataframe "billboard" into two dataframes that each store one observational unit.
- About average heights. What's the country with the tallest men? Defining two variables "country_tallest_men" as a string and "height_tallest_men".
- In which country is the difference of average heights between men and women largest?
- The Pearson's correlation value of average male and average female height.

**PART 2**
- Main topics: 
> - Matplotlib
> - Introduction to more advanced visualization tools
